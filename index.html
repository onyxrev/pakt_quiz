Level 1-2: Lost Cause (0-3, 3-6)
…we need to talk. You don’t have to do this to yourself. You’re not just hurting yourself, you’re also embarrassing your family and friends. Please, get help.

Level 3- 4: Coffee Utilitarian (7-10, 11-13)
We can tell that you care about coffee, but let’s be honest. You could care more. A lot more.

Level 5-6: Coffee Novice (14-17, 18-21)
You’re not quite a coffee snob, but that’s okay! Everyone starts somewhere. With a small amount of time, attention, and an investment in a $200 burr grinder, we’re confident you can get there.

Level 7-8: Coffee Connoisseur (22-25, 26-29)
You, sir or madam, care. Clearly you understand how to make a great cup of coffee and respect the hard work that goes into every cup. Did you ever work as a barista? Well, you could have… if only you applied yourself.

Level 9-10: Unapologetic Coffee Snob (30-34, 35-39)
Congratulations, you are a true coffee elitist. We bet you sneered when you saw this quiz and the only reason you took it was to catch an error and make jokes about it with your barista buddies next time you’re at “the shop” enjoying “a ‘spro”. Keep enjoying fantastic coffee, we love you. And also fear you.
